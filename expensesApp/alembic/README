Alembic Database Migrations
===========================

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

The migrations are designed to work with the raw SQL / Active Record pattern
used by this application (no SQLAlchemy ORM).

Usage
-----

Run migrations:
    alembic upgrade head

Create a new migration:
    alembic revision -m "description of change"

Show current version:
    alembic current

Show migration history:
    alembic history

Downgrade one version:
    alembic downgrade -1

Downgrade to specific version:
    alembic downgrade <revision_id>

Notes
-----

Since this application uses raw SQL queries instead of SQLAlchemy ORM,
autogenerate won't work. All migrations must be written manually.

Each migration should include both upgrade() and downgrade() functions
to allow rolling back changes.

For SQLite-specific considerations:
- SQLite doesn't support DROP COLUMN or ALTER COLUMN in all cases
- Use batch_alter_table for complex table modifications
- Consider data migrations for column type changes
